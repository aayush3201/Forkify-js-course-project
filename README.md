Hello!
This is a simple app that I have designed as a project. This project was not my own due to my lack of knowledge of HTML and CSS. This project was created step-by-step in the video lectures of an online javascript course y the instructor. Once I saw the videos, I started coding the app on my own. Only the javascript portion was coded by
me. The HTML and CSS files were provided by the instructor of the online course. Although the the instructor demonstrated how to create the app in Javascript,
I did not refer to the lectures while creating it myself. I used my own logics and it turned out to work perfectly. 
I provide the files of my project. 

To use the app, you will node.js installed. Once you have installed and extracted the files for this app, change your directory to the Forkify-js-couse-project folder on the command line and type in 'npm install' to get all the dependencies. Then type in 'npm run start' (make sure your default browser is Chrome). This will start the app!
 
I must say, after being successful in creating an app in a way quite different from the instructo and still achieving all I wanted to, I have become very confident in my ability to solve complex problems.
