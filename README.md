Hello!
This was a simple app that I designed without referring to the video lectures of the course that I was doing. Only the javascript part was done by
me. The HTML and CSS files were provided by the instructor of the online course. Although the the instructor demonstrated how to create the app in Javascript,
I did not refer to the lectures while creating it myself. I used my own logics and it turned out to work perfectly. 
I provide the files of my project. I am not not sure if I've uploaded everything required for the project. Also, the app only works with a develpment 
server since Chrome cannot load svg files. Use command 'npm run start' in case you want to see the app functioning. Dependencies, webpack etc. might be required too.
