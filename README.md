This is a comparitively more complex app that I have designed as a project for the javascript course. The javascript of this project was coded by me in about a day. The logic used is one hundred percent my own. The HTML and CSS were provided by the instructor, but this time, I did make some changes to the HTML according to what my logic demanded. This app reinforced my knowledge of importing/exporting data to/from models and also allowed me to get hands-on experience with modern-day web development tools. This project gives me a sense of confidence on the knowledge I have gained since it is more complicated than the other two projects.

I once again declare that this app is not my own but does prove to be a good demonstration of my programming skills.  

Directions:-

To use the app, you will need node.js installed. Once you have installed and extracted the files for this app, change your directory to the Forkify-js-course-project folder on the command line and type in 'npm install' to get all the dependencies. Make sure your default browser is Chrome. Then type in 'npm run start' to load the app with the devServer (this is necessary to load all svg files which is not supported by Chrome). This will start the app!
 
About the app:-

The Forkify app uses a food-api which has a bunch of select keywords which when entered in the search box, return 28 recipes related to that keyword. The user can select a recipe, view the ingredients needed to make a specific number of servings and then add these ingredients to a shopping list. This shopping list can also be mutated to some extent. Liked recipes are stored in the local storage of the browser so that they are present even when the browser is reloaded. Links to directions of preparation are provided with each recipe.
